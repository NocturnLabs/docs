# OpenCode Autocode

OpenCode Autocode is an autonomous coding agent that implements features from specifications without manual intervention.

## Features

- **Autonomous Development**: Continuous feature implementation from `feature_list.json`
- **Build Verification**: Automatic compilation and test validation
- **Iterative Enhancement**: Self-improving code based on feedback loops
- **Multi-language Support**: Works with Rust, Go, TypeScript, Python, and more

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yumlabs/yumlabs-opencode-autocode

# Build the project
cargo build --release
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize a new autonomous project
opencode auto-init "Build a REST API with user authentication"

# Continue development in an existing project
opencode auto-continue

# Enhance and refactor existing code
opencode auto-enhance
```

## Configuration

Create an `autocode.toml` in your project root:

```toml
[models]
planning = "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
coding = "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"

[autonomous]
max_iterations = 100
build_command = "cargo build"
test_command = "cargo test"
```
